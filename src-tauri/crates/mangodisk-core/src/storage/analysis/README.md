# Analysis scan metrics

`AnalysisScanMode::Standard` is the default for Core and adapters. It reports
native allocated bytes using the existing platform stream or traversal fallback.
`Fast` fully traverses the same accessible scope and exclusions, but uses logical
file length from metadata without querying native allocation. Compressed and
sparse file lengths can differ substantially from their disk usage. Both modes
preserve no-follow traversal, hard-link charging, cancellation and delete preflight.

Results and in-memory directory aggregates carry the mode. Navigation, remainder
lists and delete reconciliation use that metric. Reusing an index in another mode
is forbidden; overlapping indexes in different metrics are invalidated rather than
patched. Deletions from another metric invalidate the incompatible index.

The frontend defaults to standard on startup and discards navigation results when
switching modes. Its labels describe standard bytes as disk usage and fast bytes
as file size. The standard CLI/Core convenience APIs retain their default behavior;
call `AnalysisService::analyze_with_mode_progress` to select a metric explicitly.
